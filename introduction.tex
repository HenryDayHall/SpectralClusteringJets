\section{Introduction}

I am a student from the NGCM,
an interdisciplinary doctoral training centre focused on 
computational problem solving across STEM fields.
The investigations presented here straddle a number of topics, machine learning, high energy experimental physics and high energy phenomenology. 
This has been possible thanks to training
from both the physics and computer science departments
during the first year of this course,
and continued feedback at conferences and workshops, detailed in section %TODO

Stefano Moretti (Physics, Univeristy of Southampton) provides supervision and guidance on the phenomenology aspect,
Claire Shepherd-Themistocleous (CMS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) provides supervision with experimental expertises and
Srinandan Dasmahapatra (Computer Science, University of Southampton) provides supervision with regards to machine learning.
