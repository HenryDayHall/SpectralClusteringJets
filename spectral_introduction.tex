\section{Introduction}\label{sec:JetClustering}

The preferred choice for jet clustering in the context of hadron collider physics tends to be one of three algorithms:  
the \antikt{}~\cite{Cacciari2008akt}, the Cambridge-Aachen~\cite{Dokshitzer:1997in,Wobisch1998caJet} or the $k_T$  one~\cite{Ellis1993ktJet}, that have  eventually replaced cone algorithms, which had seen widespread use prior to their advent, all of these having seen  their origin in $e^+e^-$ physics, see  Refs.~\cite{Sterman:1977wj,Bethke:1991wk,Catani:1991hj,Moretti:1998qx}.
They have been the default choice for some time because they have a number of desirable properties.
They are infrared safe, excellent implementations of them are publicly available (see \fastjet{}~\cite{Cacciari2011FastJet})
and they are flexible enough to capture many different jets signals with minimal parameter changes.
These algorithms are recursive (or iterative) and agglomerative.
A recursive algorithm is well suited to clustering objects when the number of groups is not known from the outset.
Agglomerative algorithms are easier to design in a manner that is infrared safe,
as collinear particles tend to combine early due to their small angle while
 soft particles tend to combine with hard particles rather than combining  among themselves.

Jet definition precedes further algorithmic methods to extract useful
physical quantities. Finding an alternative clustering method that compares favourably to
these popular jet algorithms and which offer additional features for further analysis is a
useful goal. Success in obtaining clusters based on informative transformations of the data
offers the possibility of exploiting such representations.
In this paper, we use Laplacian eigenmaps \cite{BelkinNiyogi2003} to represent the particles
in an event, a procedure employed in applications such as image segmentation \cite{ShiMalik1997}
and called spectral clustering \cite{NgJordanWeiss2002}.
Spectral clustering has had success also in other physics contexts, such as to identify the motion
of vortices~\cite{hadjighasem2016votex} in fluid dynamics and determining the correct number of clusters.
Furthermore, to reduce the risk of blackouts, power grids may be subdivided into `islands',
which are
electromechanically stable regions with minimum load shedding.
The ideal location of such islands is found by minimising the power flow between them using spectral clustering as shown in~\cite{Li2005}.  A hierarchical, agglomerative algorithm for the same was introduced in~\cite{fennelly2014power}.
This agglomerative approach is what we show to be suitable for the context of jet physics in this paper.

The plan of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we will introduce the fundamentals of the theory of spectral clustering. In the following one, we will describe the details of the specific method that we have applied. The numerical results will then follow. Finally, we will draw our conclusions.
