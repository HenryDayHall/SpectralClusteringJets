  abstract	= {New particles beyond the Standard Model might be produced
		  with a very high boost, for instance if they result from
		  the decay of a heavier particle. If the former decay
		  hadronically, then their signature is a single massive fat
		  jet which is difficult to separate from {QCD} backgrounds.
		  Jet substructure and machine learning techniques allow for
		  the discrimination of many specific boosted objects from
		  {QCD}, but the scope of possibilities is very large, and a
		  suite of dedicated taggers may not be able to cover every
		  possibility - in addition to making experimental searches
		  cumbersome. In this paper we describe a generic
		  model-independent tagger that is able to discriminate a
		  wide variety of hadronic boosted objects from {QCD} jets
		  using N -subjettiness variables, with a significance
		  improvement varying between 2 and 8. This is in addition to
		  any improvement that might come from a cut on jet mass.
		  Such a tagger can be used in model-independent searches for
		  new physics yielding fat jets. We also show how such a
		  tagger can be applied to signatures over a wide range of
		  jet masses without sculpting the background distributions,
		  allowing to search for new physics as bumps on jet mass
		  distributions.},

  abstract	= {Since the machine learning techniques are improving
		  rapidly, it has been shown that the image recognition
		  techniques in deep neural networks can be used to detect
		  jet substructure. And it turns out that deep neural
		  networks can match or outperform traditional approach of
		  expert features. However, there are disadvantages such as
		  sparseness of jet images. Based on the natural tree-like
		  structure of jet sequential clustering, the recursive
		  neural networks ({RecNNs}), which embed jet clustering
		  history recursively as in natural language processing, have
		  a better behavior when confronted with these problems. We
		  thus try to explore the performance of {RecNNs} in
		  quark/gluon discrimination. The results show that {RecNNs}
		  work better than the baseline boosted decision tree ({BDT})
		  by a few percent in gluon rejection rate. However, extra
		  implementation of particle flow identification only
		  increases the performance slightly. We also experimented on
		  some relevant aspects which might influence the performance
		  of the networks. It shows that even taking only particle
		  flow identification as input feature without any extra
		  information on momentum or angular position is already
		  giving a fairly good result, which indicates that the most
		  of the information for quark/gluon discrimination is
		  already included in the tree-structure itself. As a bonus,
		  a rough up/down quark jets discrimination is also
		  explored.},

		  showers and resummations. We point out that they can be
		  created for individual jets through repeated
		  Cambridge/Aachen declustering, providing a powerful visual
		  representation of the radiation within any given jet.
		  Concentrating here on the primary Lund plane, we outline
		  some of its analytical properties, highlight its scope for
		  constraining Monte Carlo simulations and comment on its
		  relation with existing observables such as the zg variable
		  and the iterated soft-drop multiplicity. We then examine
		  its use for boosted electroweak boson tagging at high
		  momenta. It provides good performance when used as an input
		  to machine learning. Much of this performance can be
		  reproduced also within a transparent log-likelihood method,
		  whose underlying assumption is that different regions of
		  the primary Lund plane are largely decorrelated. This
		  suggests a potential for unique insight and experimental
		  validation of the features being used by machine-learning

		  We establish a powerful graph-theoretic representation of

  abstract	= {I describe a framework for the presentation of search
		  results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The
		  most well-known use of this framework is for the combined
		  search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino
		  oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich
		  information available in the framework for exclusion and
		  discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for
		  setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion
		  intervals while the determination of confidence intervals
		  advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more
		  appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going
		  beyond discovery to measurement. (From the workshop

  abstract	= {Deep learning has led to several breakthroughs outside the
		  field of high energy physics, yet in jet reconstruction for
		  the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC it has not been used so
		  far. This report shows results of applying deep learning
		  strategies to jet reconstruction at the stage of
		  identifying the original parton association of the jet (jet
		  tagging), which is crucial for physics analyses at the LHC
		  experiments. We introduce a custom deep neural network
		  architecture for jet tagging. We compare the performance of
		  this novel method with the other established approaches at
		  CMS and show that the proposed strategy provides a
		  significant improvement. The strategy provides the first
		  multi-class classifier, instead of the few binary
		  classifiers that previously were used, and thus yields more
		  information and in a more convenient way. The performance
		  results obtained with simulation imply a significant
		  improvement for a large number of important physics
		  analysis at the CMS experiment.}
