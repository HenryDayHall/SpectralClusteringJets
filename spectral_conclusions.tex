\subsubsection{Going forward}
From here, there a two possible ways forward;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduce some \(p_T\) dependence.
        Due to the high parameter space this will require writing in
        an optimiser.
        Not conceptually difficult, but time consuming.
    \item Investigate Diffusion mapping.
        This has some resemblance to \ref{compressionstep} in the current method.
        It might also provide a faster algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

I am inclined to try 1 first then 2
because I am confident 1 will yield results.
